content provider : help to access to data stored by itself, stored by other apps,
and provide a way to share data with other apps.

content provider provides abstraction from handling this inter process communication
in real word scenerio app1 could be a context which contains different  context stored by user in the device
and app2 coul be whatsapp/skype which trying to  access context stored in device

for app2 perespective it doesn't matter how the stored in context app,(
  it could be savedin file,json, database
)

how does app1 expose it's data securely to app2 -> content provider


context object contains a method  getContentResolver () returns instance of content resolver
to hit correct correct content provider ,need Uri (Uri woold be unique for Cp)


content resolver provide ->Crud Methods also can perform batch operation


===========================
data return from content provider is tabular form

cursor -> is an api that allows to traverse those rows in tabular data

// query is equivalent to select query
//  most of the uri defined under android.provider
getContentResolver().query(<ContentProvider>.CONTENT_URI,mProjection,mSelctionClause,mSortOrder)

mProjection (no of columns that we want ot query ) - string array representing names of columns
mSelctionClause - > equivalent to where clause
mSortOrder(String type) -> order in which want  query to sorted
